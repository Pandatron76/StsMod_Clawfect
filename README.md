## Introductions
The first full 'proper' mod I wrote for a friend(s) who enjoys playing claws.  
This mod 'clawitizes' the defect with more claw related options. Best to just play the mod so nothing is spoiled :).

## Getting Started
1. Make sure to have the latest version of...  
&nbsp;ModTheSpire (https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/releases)  
&nbsp;BaseMod (https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/releases)
2. Navigate to: https://github.com/Pandatron76/StsMod_Clawfect/releases and download the latest release
3. Follow the steps as detailed by kiooeht in his 'README.md' file here: https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire

## F.A.Q.
Q: Is this meant to be balanced?  
A: It was mainly a fun mod for a friend(s) so there was some balance but nothing substantial.

Q: What happen to the original claw? Why am I only finding Vintage Claw?  
A: The original 'Claw' lacks a CardTag to know what other cards are also claws.
To work around this, a new 'Claw' card was created so that the claw 'CardTag' can be associated to it. 
It is similar to how 'Strike' cards work where other strikes know what other strike cards are. 

Q: Why does my starting relic (Dr Claw) provide -1 energy?  
A: Honestly I think it should be -2 but for now it is -1. Mainly due to balancing reasons. 
Starting with 3 energy and a bunch of low cost cards seems a bit strong. Especially if those cards are claws. 
In a future state I would probably add a configuration item to allow the user to adjust their starting energy
of the relic. This would help account for people who want less/more energy at the start based on how they have fun.

Q: Why do all my claws start with dealing negative damage?  
A: Balancing reasons. Also due to laziness. For all the claw version of each card, I just made the number(s) negative.

Q: Was this built/tested with any ascensions in mind?  
A: This mod was not written with any specific ascension in mind.

Q: I have suggestions/ideas for this mod. How can I reach out to you?

Q: I found a (potential) bug. How do I report it?
A: Feel free to reach out to me at pandatron76{(at)}gmail{(dot)}com or submit an issue and 
I will see if i can reproduce it.
